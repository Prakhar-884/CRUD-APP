# CRUD-APP
 MERN stack CRUD apps manage data with MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. MongoDB stores data, Express.js handles server logic, Node.js runs the backend, and React.js builds the user interface, enabling seamless data operations in web applications.
MERN Stack CRUD Application
Overview
This project is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using the MERN stack. It allows users to perform basic operations on a dataset, leveraging MongoDB for data storage, Express.js and Node.js for the backend server and API, and React.js for the frontend user interface.

Features
Create: Add new entries to the database.
Read: Retrieve and display existing data.
Update: Modify existing entries in the database.
Delete: Remove entries from the database.
Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js, Axios (for HTTP requests)
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB (using Mongoose for ORM)
